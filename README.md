# What is Terraform
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool used to manage the provisioning and configuration of cloud resources across multiple cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and others. It enables developers to write code that declaratively describes the desired state of their infrastructure, which is then used to automate the deployment and management of that infrastructure. With Terraform, changes to the code can be easily tracked, versioned, and shared among teams, making it a powerful tool for managing complex infrastructure architectures.
